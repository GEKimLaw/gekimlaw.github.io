<p>Our law firm is dedicated to supporting families through special education-related school discipline challenges, offering guidance at every stage, from Manifestation Determination Reviews (MDRs) to attending critical meetings for Functional Behavioral Assessments (FBAs) and Behavioral Intervention Plans (BIPs). We understand that disciplinary issues for students with disabilities require a tailored approach that considers their unique needs and rights. Our experienced advocates work alongside families during MDRs to ensure that a child’s behavior is appropriately evaluated in relation to their disability and that the outcome reflects an understanding of their individual circumstances.</h4> 
<p> In addition, we provide support at school discipline hearings and any follow-up meetings related to IEPs, FBAs, and BIPs. Whether it’s advocating for a comprehensive behavioral plan or ensuring that disciplinary actions are fair and legal, we are committed to protecting your child’s right to a supportive learning environment. We stand by our clients in these challenging situations, helping to secure necessary accommodations, positive behavioral supports, and, when needed, alternative placements. Our goal is to empower families to advocate for the best outcomes and provide your child with a path to succeed, even through complex disciplinary matters.</p>
