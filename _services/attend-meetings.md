<p>Attending IEP, 504, eligibility, and reevaluation meetings with families is one of the ways our law firm actively supports parents and students. We bring our expertise to ensure that your child’s needs are clearly communicated and effectively addressed, working alongside you to advocate for comprehensive evaluations, accurate eligibility determinations, and the right accommodations or modifications. By being present in these meetings, we help keep the process focused on what’s best for your child, so that the supports provided are not only appropriate but tailored to their unique learning needs.
<p>In addition, we assist families in navigating decisions around the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE), a critical component of your child’s educational plan. Determining the LRE involves balancing academic, social, and emotional needs, and we’re here to guide you through understanding the placement options that may best serve your child. Our goal is to empower you to make informed decisions and ensure that your child is placed in a setting where they can thrive, progress, and build their skills with confidence.
