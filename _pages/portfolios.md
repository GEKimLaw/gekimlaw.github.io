      text: "Grace was a fierce advocate for our family and worked overtime to respond promptly with information and strategy to support our needs. Her wise council brought about a resolution that was more than we had hoped for and helped us get what we needed for our son. We are so grateful to have a fresh start and know that our child is safe from further harm." 
    - name: "Doug"
      position: "Former Client"
      image: "/assets/images/testimonial_2.jpg"
      text: "Grace represented us for FAPE placement / due process claims with Loudoun County Public Schools. We worked with her over a two-year span. She provided competent legal counsel and we recommend her services. I don't recommend going into due process related proceedings without representation. Grace was reasonably priced and very responsive." 
    - name: "Kim"
      position: "Former Client"
      image: "/assets/images/testimonial_3.jpg"
      text: "Grace Eunjung Kim is by far the most professional articulate, and get-it-resolved attorney we have ever seen. Professional, organized, attentive, kind and yet is so well versed in law and highly educated, she should be charging 3 times the cost. We highly recommend her and look forward to hiring her again, should the need arise." 
    - name: "Dave"
      position: "Former Client"
      image: "/assets/images/testimonial_3.jpg"
      text: "We were very fortunate to work with Grace. She was recommended to us by another attorney who was retiring. She helped us through a very stressful episode, providing expert advice and representation. She took into account our specific family situation and needs. We would definitely work with her again."       
    - name: "Lisa Misch"
      position: "Former Client"

      text: "I would highly recommend Ms Kim. She is a very compassionate, caring and understanding person. I am truly appreciative of her help, without it J**** would have dropped out and obtained a GED. There was no pathway to a diploma. Ms. Kim obtained a pathway which I could have never done on my own."
